  - Press O and P to grow and shrink in the hub. Hold Alt for 5x!

  - Size control anywhere is a config option!
  - Stuck? Alt-U to _temporarily_ reset your size if you get stuck! Works anywhere, no matter what!
## Size and Pitch Limits!
  Don't want Mel to sound like Typhon? Don't want her to fill the whole screen? Try something more modest.
